## Pewlett Hackard Retiring Staff
### Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis we create tables to summarize potential employees who will soon be retiring during the upcoming "silver tsunami". We filter to only those born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Additionally, we look for staff members who may be eligible for the mentorship program by identifying those born in the year 1965.

### Results
We found that approximately 90,398 employees may take part in the "silver tsunami". It should be noted that most employees retiring are in high level positions. 

The results breakdown is as follows:

In our analysis metorship program analysis it was found that a total of 1,549 employees are eligible. It should be noted that no employees were found to be eligible for the Manager mentorship program. However, this should not impact the company to a great degree because only 2 Managers could be retiring in the near future.

### Summary
As the "Silver tsunami" approaches it was concluded that potentially 90,398 employees may retire by filtering to employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. It was also concluded that 1,549 employees may be eligible for the mentorship program. It would be wise to ease on the requirements to take part in the mentorship program because at this rate less that 2% of the retiring staff will be replaced by internal staff.
